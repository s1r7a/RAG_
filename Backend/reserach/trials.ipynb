This document includes a \\ndetailed narrative for each of the Endgame \\nPlan strategic objectives, broken down by \\ngeography where appropriate. The narrative is \\nfollowed by a series of annexes that contain the \\nmonitoring framework indicators for endemic \\ncountries, outbreak countries and high-risk \\ncountries, and global indicators.\\nAt the time of the GPEI’s founding in 1988, polio \\nwas endemic in more than 125 countries and \\nparalysed 350\\xa0000 children every year. Since \\nthen, the GPEI has overseen a 99% reduction \\nin annual cases of polio. Today, only three \\ncountries remain endemic to wild poliovirus \\n(WPV) transmission, and the world is closer \\nthan ever to being polio-free.\\nThe strategies outlined in the Endgame Plan \\nhave bought the world to the brink of polio \\neradication and have set the groundwork for \\nsustaining a polio-free world in perpetuity. \\nLooking ahead, these strategies will be further \\nevaluated and refined in an extension of the \\nEndgame Plan, which is being developed \\nand will be finalized in early 2019. Crucially, \\nthe programme must look not only to sustain \\nprogress, but to overcome the challenges \\nposed by the increasing importance of \\nremoving the threat of circulating vaccine-\\nderived polioviruses (cVDPVs). While not a new \\nphenomenon, with no more cVDPVs today than \\nin previous years, it is clear that a polio-free \\nworld means one in which no child is paralysed \\nby any form of the virus.\\nThis underlines the urgency of eradicating \\nWPVs. A dual emergency must be faced: to \\neradicate WPV to protect children everywhere; \\nand to do so not only to prevent cases of WPV \\nparalysis and the global re-emergence of \\npolioviruses, but also to phase out the use \\nof the oral polio vaccine (OPV) as swiftly as \\npossible, to prevent future cases of cVDPV.\\nIn the meantime, in the first six months of 2018, \\nwork continued with countries to bolster this \\neffort through maintaining and strengthening \\nhigh vaccination coverage. This protects \\npopulations from outbreaks and is the only \\nsure way to eradicate the virus once and for \\nall. After eradication of polio has been certified, \\nthe Post-Certification Strategy (PCS) will guide \\nthe activities that need to be implemented \\nand the functions that must be sustained \\nto maintain a world free of polio. This work \\nwas strengthened by new support from Gavi, \\nthe Vaccine Alliance, for inactivated polio \\nvaccine (IPV) in priority countries and continued \\nimprovements in the IPV supply situation.\\nThe steps to prepare for a lasting polio-free \\nworld must also continue. At the Seventy-\\nfirst World Health Assembly in May 2018, \\na resolution was passed calling for strong \\nMember State commitment to accelerate \\ncontainment. The importance of effective \\npoliovirus containment is perhaps best \\nillustrated by recalling that the last infection \\ndue to smallpox virus – the only human \\npathogen to have been eradicated globally \\nthus far – occurred as a result of an accidental \\nlaboratory containment failure. In a limited \\nnumber of facilities, poliovirus will continue \\nto be retained to serve critical national and \\ninternational functions, such as the production \\nof polio vaccine or research. It is crucial that \\nthis poliovirus material be appropriately \\ncontained under strict biosafety and biosecurity \\nhandling and storage conditions, to ensure \\nthat virus is not released into the environment, \\neither accidentally or intentionally, to again \\ncause outbreaks of the disease in susceptible \\npopulations. That is why the resolution on the \\ncontainment of polioviruses adopted by the \\nWorld Health Assembly is so important.

This disease has existed for millennia, \\nparalysing millions of children all over the \\nworld. As recently as 1985, polio was causing \\nlifelong paralysis in over 350\\xa0000 children in \\nmore than 125 countries.\\nSince that time, WPV has been reduced by more \\nthan 99.99%. So far in 2018, only 13 cases of \\nWPV have been reported, from a handful of \\ndistricts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is \\nthe closest the world has ever been to being \\npolio-free. But polio is a highly infectious \\ndisease that will not go without a fight. That is \\nthe nature of eradication efforts: success is a \\nmust or the disease will come roaring back. \\nIf the latter occurs, the world will again face \\n200\\xa0000 new cases, every single year. Those \\nare 200\\xa0000 children each year who will no \\nlonger be able to walk to school, who will be \\nparalysed for life.\\nPolio eradication – a dual emergency\\nRecognizing this risk, the World Health \\nOrganization declared the effort to eradicate \\npolio a Public Health Emergency of International \\nConcern. But in fact, the eradication of polio has \\nnow become a dual emergency. The progress \\nin eradicating WPV has been achieved through \\nlarge-scale immunization campaigns using \\nthe OPV. As the vaccine is administered orally, \\nit can be delivered to children easily no matter \\nwhere they live. Importantly, it does not just \\nprotect individual vaccinated children but also \\ncurbs WPV in their communities by preventing \\nperson-to-person spread. It is this public health \\nbenefit that has eradicated the disease from \\nvirtually every country in the world.\\nBut a drawback is associated with OPV. \\nThe vaccine is made of live poliovirus that \\nhas been genetically weakened so it induces \\nimmunity in a vaccinated child and does \\nnot cause paralysis. When excreted by the \\nvaccinated child, the vaccine provides immunity \\nto other children in that community, protecting \\nthem. As long as the excreted vaccine-virus \\ndoes not reach susceptible (unvaccinated) \\nchildren for an extended period of time, it dies \\nout completely.\\nThe problem occurs in areas where vaccination \\nrates are so low that the vaccine-virus continues \\nto circulate. The longer it circulates, the more \\nit genetically changes. On rare occasions, \\nit changes to the extent that it becomes a \\n“strong” virus, able to cause paralysis. \\nThis takes a long time – about a year of \\nextended circulation. The child who received \\nthe original OPV dose 12 months earlier will \\nremain protected, so the changes are not a \\nside effect of the vaccine but a devastating \\nconsequence of low population immunity.\\nThis is causing the dual emergency. While so \\nfar in 2018, only 13 cases due to WPV have been \\nreported worldwide, an additional 15 children \\nhave been paralysed by outbreaks of these \\nother viruses, the cVDPVs. These outbreaks \\nwill continue to occur, as long as the world \\ncontinues to use OPV.\\nThis risk has always been recognized and \\nis included in the strategy. Once countries \\neradicate WPV, they already intend to stop using \\nOPV and protect their populations through IPV. \\nSince IPV cannot cause cVDPVs, it is the ideal \\ntool for a post-polio world.\\nSEMI-ANNUAL STATUS REPORT | JANUARy TO JUNE 2018\\n5\\n5'),\n",

In other words, the \\nremaining 5% that make almost 2 million unimmunized children should be reached \\nduring consecutive campaigns in a short interval to ensure all children are \\ncovered.Furthermore, once the polio virus is detected in a certain area, an \\nadditional campaign will be carried out for that district to prevent potential \\noutbreak of polio amongst children in the community.

This means that in areas with poor hygiene and sanitation,immunization \\nwith OPVcan result in ‘passive’ immunization of people who have not been \\nvaccinated.IPV, or inactivated polio vaccine, is an extremely safe vaccine and \\nhighly effective in protecting children from polio.
